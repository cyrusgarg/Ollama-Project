## 📌 REPO Overview
This project is a hands-on exploration of Ollama — a tool for running large language models locally. It demonstrates how to set up custom models, process text, and integrate them with Python for building practical AI-powered applications.

## 📌 REPO Includes
-Working with Modelfiles to create and customize Ollama models
-Streaming responses from models using Python requests
-Experimenting with PDF ingestion and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
-A simple portfolio-style frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) that can be extended to interact with models

## 🚀 Features
**Work with Ollama models:** creating and managing custom model builds

**Use Python with APIs:** sending prompts, handling streaming responses, parsing JSON

**Document loading and RAG basics:** extracting text from PDFs, preparing embeddings for search

**Frontend development:** HTML + CSS responsive design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
**Python**
**Ollama**(LLMs Manager)
**LangChain**
**Git/GitHub**
